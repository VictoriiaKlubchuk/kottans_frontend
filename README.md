## Task 0

* The course about Git was very interesting. I learnt and got some practise with command `git pull request` and how to navigate branches.

* As for me, course took too much time. But it is because I want to complete all tasks for shorter period of time and I count every  minute.

* Nonetheless, I intend to use this knowledge further in my work. Git is really useful tool for developers.

> Thanks for the course!


## Task 1

#### Linux Command Line Basics

* The course refreshed my knowledge how to navigate on Linux in Terminal.

* It is not deep course, just a few simple commands.

* Some command I used to use, but now I use Windows.

> It was good experience!

#### Configuring Linux Web Servers

* There are a log of new information. I leant some new commands such as `vagrant up`, `vagrant ssh`, `finger [user_name]`... about Octal Permissions and how to break out this entry.

* Some information on the course was new. So after some time I am going to repeat this course. I think, this cousre was very useful.

> Thanks for this challenge.

#### Networking For Web Developers

* Almost all informations in this course was new for me. So it was quite challenging.

* Despite of this, it showed me how internet works, what IPv4 & IPv6 are, how connections between users work, what Protocols and Ports are. All information are useful.

* This course broaden my horizons at this field and gave me answers on my questions.

> It was as hard as interesting. :thumbsup:
