## Task 0

* The course about Git was very interesting. I learnt and got some practise with `git pull request` and how navigate branches.

* As for me, course took too much, but it because I want to complete all tasks for shorter period of time and I count every  minute.

* Anyway, I intend to use this knowladge firther ib my work. Git really useful tool for developers.

> Thanks for the course!
