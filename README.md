## Task 0

* The course about Git was very interesting. I learnt and got some practise with command `git pull request` and how to navigate branches.

* As for me, course took too much time. But it is because I want to complete all tasks for shorter period of time and I count every  minute.

* Nonetheless, I intend to use this knowledge further in my work. Git is really useful tool for developers.

> Thanks for the course!
